Hi, this is my submission for the Xendit Test,

please do the following,
- npm install supertest
- npm install chai
- npm test

Notes : 
These tests will always passed because i dont have the playground to test in real case.
for the variety of cases already covered on the title of every test in test.js.


Thanks for taking your time to review this code.
